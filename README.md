# Methodological-framework-forComparison-of-experimental-activities-in-Federated-Learning-applications
A methodological framework is proposed that allows for a systematic and reproducible evaluation of the various Federated Learning techniques. This framework provides a standardized system for recording and analyzing experiments, ensuring that the results are comparable with each other.
Below, I have included an image of a Class Diagram that illustrates the components and relationships present in the XML code of the framework.
